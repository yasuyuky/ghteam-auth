### On linux

```
cargo build --release
```

### Cross-compile on other platforms using Docker

```
# to build sectora
docker-compose run --rm builder

# to build deb package
docker-compose run --rm package
```

See Makefile and docker-compose.yml for details

## How to install and setup

1. Copy executable and shared object to each path
2. Put config file for this program
3. Configure name service switch
4. Configure sshd
5. Configure PAM

[A setting example of ansible is available](https://github.com/yasuyuky/sectora/blob/master/ansible/)

### Copy the executable file and shared object to each path

#### Copy executable file

Put `sectora` to `/usr/sbin/`.

#### Copy shared object

Put `libnss_sectora.so` to `/usr/lib/`.

#### Create link of shared object

`ln -s /usr/lib/libnss_sectora.so /usr/lib/libnss_sectora.so.2`

### Put config file for this program.

The minimal setting is like as follows.

```toml
token = "YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN_STRING"
org = "YOUR_ORGANIZATION"

[[team]]
name = "YOUR_TEAM1"
gid = YOUR_GID1

[[team]]
name = "YOUR_TEAM2"
gid = YOUR_GID1
group = "YOUR_GROUP_NAME"

[[repo]]
name = "YOUR_REPO_NAME"
```

See `struct Config` on `structs.rs` for details.

### Configure name service switch

Add the following lines to `/etc/nsswitch.conf`

```
passwd: files sectora
shadow: files sectora
group:  files sectora
```

### Configure sshd

Add the following lines to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

```
AuthorizedKeysCommandUser root
AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/sbin/sectora key %u
UsePAM yes
```

#### In the case of old sshd

In the case of old sshd, you need to create the following shell script and put it in your PATH.

```sectora.sh
#!/bin/bash
/usr/sbin/sectora key $1
```

Also, sshd_config should look like this.

```
AuthorizedKeysCommandUser root
AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/sbin/sectora.sh
UsePAM yes
```

### Configure PAM

Add the following lines to `/etc/pam.d/sshd`.

```
auth requisite pam_exec.so quiet expose_authtok /usr/sbin/sectora pam
auth optional pam_unix.so not_set_pass use_first_pass nodelay
session required pam_mkhomedir.so skel: /etc/skel/ umask: 0022
```

Also, comment out the following line.

```
# @include common-auth
```

## Personal settings

To set personal settings, use `$HOME/.config/sectora.toml` like this.

```toml
sh = "/path/to/login/shell"
pass = "PASSWORD_HASH_STRING"
```

Use `mkpasswd` command to create your `PASSWORD_HASH_STRING`

```
mkpasswd -S $(head -c 4 /dev/urandom|xxd -p) -m sha-512
```
